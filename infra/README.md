# Infrastructure

This directory contains infrastructure configuration and deployment scripts for Ghost Engine. It includes Cloud Run configurations, Terraform modules, and other setup files for deploying services and supporting resources.

- `cloudrun.yaml` – baseline service manifest for the orchestrator (to be expanded).
- `terraform/` – optional modules for networking, secrets, and artifact registry (future).
