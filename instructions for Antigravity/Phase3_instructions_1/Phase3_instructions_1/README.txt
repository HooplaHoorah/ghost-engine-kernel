Phase3_instructions_1 Bundle
===========================

This zip bundle contains the key documents and instructions needed for Google Antigravity to update
the Ghost Engine GitHub repository for Phase 3 while preserving the work from Phase 1 and Phase 2.

Files included:

1. **ghost_engine_repo_overhaul_plan.md** – A detailed plan that proposes a new monorepo structure for the Ghost Engine repo, explains the rationale behind each directory, and lists concrete steps for refactoring.  It emphasizes preserving Phase 1/Phase 2 code in a `runtimes/ge-doom` folder while introducing a kernel-first architecture.

2. **Ghost_Engine_Phase_3_Pitch_OnePager.md** – A concise one‑page summary of the Phase 3 vision and positioning.  This document outlines the problem the Ghost Engine solves and why an open‑source interoperability kernel is needed.

3. **Ghost_Engine_Phase_3_Roadmap_CodeLaunch_and_Beyond.md** – A detailed roadmap for Phase 3, including a 12‑week execution plan, modular workstreams, and guardrails.  It covers tasks such as protocol definition, deterministic kernel, adapter SDK, Marble integration, ingestion pipeline, orchestration fabric, evaluation harness, and transmedia exports.

4. **Ghost_Engine_Phase_3_Roadmap_CodeLaunch_and_Beyond.pdf** – A PDF version of the detailed roadmap for Phase 3.  Useful for presentations or offline viewing.

5. **Ghost_Engine_North_Star_Blurb.txt** – A short blurb summarizing the long‑term “North Star” vision for Ghost Engine.  It highlights reproducibility, caching, provenance, portability across engines, and evaluation harnesses as the multi‑year shelf‑life moat.

6. **3-1 Ghost Engine RESET – ChatGPT.pdf** and **3-2 Ghost Engine RESET – ROADMAP ChatGPT.pdf** – Internal conversation transcripts that provide additional context about the Phase 3 pivot, the decision to refocus on the kernel, and the rationale behind the roadmap.

Instructions for Use:

- Review the **ghost_engine_repo_overhaul_plan.md** document to understand the proposed restructuring of the repository.  This plan explains where Phase 1 and Phase 2 code should live and how new Phase 3 modules (protocol, kernel, providers, orchestration, etc.) should be organized.

- Read the **Pitch OnePager**, **Roadmap**, and **North Star** documents to ensure alignment on the vision, goals, and execution timeline for Phase 3.

- Use the conversation PDFs for deeper insight into the decisions and trade‑offs discussed by the team.

Once you have incorporated these instructions, you can update the GitHub repository accordingly while preserving the legacy work under the appropriate runtime folder.  For further questions, refer to the detailed plan or the conversation transcripts.
